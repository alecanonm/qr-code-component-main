## My process

I start building the boilerplate following good practices in html trying to be meaning and applaying good semantic. And i applied styles using css i didn't used any figma instructions i had to ferret it out what kind of dimentions and sizes to use

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I used to use em for everything, including font sizes and layout widths. But after researching best practices, I realized that using em for fonts can lead to issues — since em is relative to the parent element, font sizes can unintentionally scale up (for example, doubling if nested).

Now, I use rem or ch for things like max-width and global font sizing. rem is more predictable because it’s always based on the root font size, and ch is great for setting text widths based on character count, which improves readability.

### Continued development

I am going to continue practicing html and then in some future i am going to keep practicing with tailwind, react and nextJS
